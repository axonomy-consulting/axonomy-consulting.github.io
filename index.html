            <p>At Axonomy, we help businesses to maximise profitability and customer satisfaction levels by
                designing and implementing bespoke technical architecture solutions. We achieve these goals
                by creating systems that minimise costs and streamline operations.

                Our technical architects understand the challenges facing modern businesses. We work side by
                side with key decision makers to translate business requirements into software architecture.

                What does this mean for your business?
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduced costs</li>
                <li>Increased profitability</li>
                <li>Increased customer satisfaction</li>
                <li>Operational excellence</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We develop efficient systems architecture that is optimised for the specific needs of the client’s
                industry. We do this by combining our knowledge of how business works with our vast
                knowledge of technical architecture design.

                We also specialise in networking, software engineering, infrastructure and security. This
                extensive skillset allows us to plan, design and execute technical architecture solutions from
                start to finish.

                In short, our consultants know what is needed to make your business more successful.

                If you’re looking for systems architecture services with a clear emphasis on business, you’ve
                come to the right place.
            </p>

            <h1>Why choose Axonomy?</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                At Axonomy, we don’t just draw diagrams and leave the hard work of implementation to others -
                we also implement the systems architecture we design.

                Our extensive experience in business is proof that we’re in tune with the needs of companies
                and organisations in the modern world.



                We take a detailed approach to every project we take on; we never cut corners with
                out-of-the-box solutions. The systems architecture we design is based on the specific
                requirements of the client. We assess the needs of the business, create solutions, and see the
                project through to technical delivery.

                Our consultants are experienced in both greenfield projects and the improvement of existing
                architecture. If your project is in the planning stages, we’ll develop new architecture from scratch
                - in line with your business objectives. Or if you need us to work on systems that are already in
                place, we will identify modifications that will benefit your operation - and communicate fully with
                key personnel to ensure a smooth transition.

                For many years, Axonomy consultants have been working within businesses to develop
                technical architecture that increases profitability and improves efficiency. We believe our holistic
                approach to systems design makes us unique - which is why our clients keep coming back.

                We specialise in web content management for e-commerce by utilising a range of
                methodologies, including High Availability Systems Design and Service Orientated Architecture.

                How do we deliver results? Well, our consultants make use of the very latest technologies out
                there, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Amazon Web Services</li>
                <li>Adobe Experience Manager</li>
                <li>Hybris</li>
                <li>Linux and Java</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Over more than a decade, we have worked on major systems architecture projects for some of
                the biggest companies in the world. We’ve been part of multi-disciplinary teams responsible for
                delivering projects for the likes of O2, Audi, Unilever and Scansafe.

                So when you choose Axonomy, your organisation gets expert technical architecture consulting,
                real-world business experience and a commitment to delivering bespoke solutions.
            </p>
            <h1>The Axonomy Ethos</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                We pride ourselves on immersing ourselves in the organisations we serve. So when you hire Axonomy to design and execute your business systems, you can be confident you’re getting  technical architects, project leaders and software developers who will genuinely care about your
                business.

                We approach every project as if it’s our first. We assess the needs of the businesses we serve -
                and only then do we start designing systems architecture that is relevant to the operation. You’ll
                never get a one-size-fits-all service from Axonomy.

                Whether you’re a sole trader or a multinational corporation, we will assess the specific needs of
                your operation and devise a bespoke solution. We’ll then use our extensive technical expertise
                to implement it.

                For technical architecture solutions from architects with real-world experience in business, turn
                to Axonomy.
